This is a hobby project to bring more to the Go servers:

Currently implemented features:
- notifications of live streams for pro games
- a multi-server wide notification for tsumego battles
- a system to set up, add or change channels related to commands and notifications

Work-in-progress or not yet implemented features:
- turning SGFs into gifs
- creating a tsumego library for discord users to call to get problems
- challenge system to play a game between two discord members. (OGS or VGS)
- a self-containing server ecosystem
  - notifications are only based on server preference (you add the channels you want to get notified about)
  - this would also work with video content and not just live streams
  
- adding twitch API to live stream notices

any and all critiques will be heavily appreciated.
I have left out the databases and kept the samples in to see the structure.
As I move forward with this project this repo will also be updated with the changes, but at different paces.
